I have 6 PCs in which I plan to install memory.

4 of the PCs have 4 memory DIMM slots.

2 of the PCs have 2 memory DIMM slots.

For all 6 PCs, each DIMM slot supports a maximum of 48 GB.

I have a number of memory sticks totaling of 736 GB.

I plan to max out the memory in 1 of the PCs with 4 memory DIMM slots and also in 1 of the PCs with 2 memory DIMM slots.

For the rest of the PCs, I will use the same GB sized memory stick to fill all available DIMM slots. What is the GB size of the memory stick I should use for the remaining PCs?
